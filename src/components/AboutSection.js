      <h1>What is SafeSpaceShare?</h1>
      <p>
        In today's diverse society, the experiences of ​individuals can vary
        widely depending on their ​surroundings. SafeSpaceShare (S3) is a web
        ​application designed to support our communities ​by giving each of us a
        platform to share our ​lived experiences in public spaces. Whether these
        ​experiences are positive or negative, S3 allows ​users to anonymously
        contribute to a collective ​map that visualizes these experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this tool is to foster inclusivity, ​safety, and awareness
        by providing a visual ​representation of how different individuals
        ​perceive and interact with their surroundings.
